# random-password-generator

## Description

This webpage will allow the user to generate a random password. This password is going to be between 8-128 and will include special characters, uppercase, lowercase, and/or numbers based upon the user's preferences. 

The user will click the "generate password" button and will be prompted by the page to input their desired password length. If the borrower inputs a number that is less than 8 or greater than 128 characters, the user will receive an alert that the password must be between 8-128 characters. If the borrower inputs something other than a number they will be alerted that their input must be a number. After the user inputs a number there will be a series of messages asking the types of characters the borrower wants to have in their password. After this the borrower will then have their random password generated for them.
